# middleware-nem-rest [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ChronoBank/middleware-nem-rest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ChronoBank/middleware-nem-rest)

Middleware service for which expose rest api

### Installation

This module is a part of middleware services. You can install it in 2 ways:

1) through core middleware installer  [middleware installer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chronobank-middleware)
2) by hands: just clone the repo, do 'npm install', set your .env - and you are ready to go

#### About
This module is used for interaction with middleware. This happens through the layer, which is built on node-red.
So, you don't need to write any code - you can create your own flow with UI tool supplied by node-red itself. Access by this route:
```
/admin
````


### Migrations
Migrations includes the predefined users for node-red (in order to access /admin route), and already predefined flows.
In order to apply migrations, type:
```
npm run migrate_red
```
The migrator wil look for the mongo_db connection string in ecosystem.config.js, in .env or from args. In case, you want run migrator with argument, you can do it like so:
```
npm run migrate_red mongodb://localhost:27017/data
```

#### Predefined Routes with node-red flows


The available routes are listed below:

| route | methods | params | description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| /addr   | POST | ``` {address: <string>} ``` | register new address on middleware.
| /addr   | DELETE | ``` {address: <string>} ``` | remove an address from middleware
| /addr/{address}/balance   | GET |  | retrieve balance of the registered address


##### —Åonfigure your .env

REST_PORT=8081
NETWORK=development
NODERED_MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27018/data
NODERED_AUTO_SYNC_MIGRATIONS=true
```
